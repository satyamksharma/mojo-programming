#1. Write a Mojo program to evaluate all arithmetic operations.

def main():
    x = 100
    y = 20
    sum = x + y
    diff = x - y
    prod = x * y
    div = x / y
    modu = x % y

    print("Sum = ", sum)
    print("Difference = ", diff)
    print("Product = ", prod)
    print("Division = ", div)
    print("Modulus = ", modu)
